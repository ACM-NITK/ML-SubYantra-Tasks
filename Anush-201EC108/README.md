I used the pandas and matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data and did data preprocessing with the help of pandas library functions.
 then I used scikit learn for training and implementing linear regression model and measured effiency of linear regression model using library functions and plotted the comparison graph using seaborn for visualisation

I believe that ML and data analytics has very high potential in the present era and I personally feel more fun to work with this for me as I like statistics and probability concepts.
 Iam looking forward to work on project from ML SubYantra and Iam presently the part of ML cli preprocessor from ACM-sanganitra
