 I used the pandas and matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data and did data preprocessing with the help of pandas library functions.
 information in the resource for scikit learn and implemented linear regression.I also wrote the multi-variable linear regression algorithm from scratch by following the concepts I learnt from Andrew Yang's course on ML.

There are a lot of cool advanced applications of ML and I want to learn the processes behind them and apply them in some of my ideas.
