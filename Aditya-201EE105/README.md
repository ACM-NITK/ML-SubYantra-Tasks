Approach: I used the information in the resource for scikit learn and implemented linear regression.I also wrote the multi-variable linear regression algorithm from scratch by following the concepts I learnt from Andrew Yang's course on ML.

There are a lot of cool advanced applications of ML and I want to learn the processes behind them and apply them in some of my ideas.
