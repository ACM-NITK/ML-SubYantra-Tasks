## Task

Using the given dataset, you have to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Do an Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset
2. Dataset preprocessing
3. Build a simple model and measure its performance using suitable metrics

You can choose to do any **one** of the **first two tasks**, but it is **highly** recommended that you do both of them.

Feel free to add additional tasks to your code, but finish the required tasks first and then go ahead.

## Instructions for the Task

### 1. Submission Format

Create a folder with your First Name and Roll Number (name-Rollno) and keep the following files in them
 - A Jupyter Notebook (**same name as the folder**) that contains the code and the detailed step-by-step documentation of what has been done
 - A **README** file that describes your approach to the task and a few lines about your interest in the field

### 2. General Instructions

 - Fork the repo and upon completion of the task, push the files (in the given format) to your fork and submit a Pull Request
 - The code will be reviewed and accordingly the screening will be done
 - Follow the Submission Format properly
 - There is no restriction on language or framework, so feel free to do the task however you please. If you are beginning now, Python and the listed resources can help you out.

### 3. Tips

 - The task is to see your enthusiasm for learning new things, so make sure you put in some genuine effort into the task
 - Try to complete the task as much as possible, we look more at the effort put in rather than the completion of the task
 - Feel free to ask any of the mentors if you are stuck at anything or if you have doubts regarding the task
