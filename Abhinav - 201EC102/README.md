# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This is a data explanation technique to understand various aspects of data. 

The objective is to identidy the important variables in the data set and remove any noise that may 
hinder the accuracy of our conclusions. 

We must be able to get insights about the given data in order to move on to other complex processes
in the data processing cycle. 

## Objective Of EDA 
1. Identifies the faulty points in data 
2. Helps us understand relationship between variables giving wider perspective on the data

## Steps involved in EDA 
1. Understand the data - number of columns and features 
2. Clean the data from any irregularities - removing unecessary variables
3. Analyse the relationship between the variables
