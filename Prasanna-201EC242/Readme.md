About the Interest in the Field 

1) I like the field and during my free time sometimes I go through the keras documentation .I also fork ppl's repository who have done nice ML prjects (example :- Brain tumor prediction) and go through the architecture.
2) I developed interest when I did my first ML prject under Envision IEEE in my first year (Face recognition and detection)
3) I want to explore more on RNN , LSTM and many more ...

Approach to the Task
